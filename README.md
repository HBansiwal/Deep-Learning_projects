the desingned network is developed for general purpose computer. Dataset contains 200 object classes and each object has 500 images for training purpose. model is developed on tensorflow framework contains convolution layer for extracting the feature from an image and fullyconnected layer with softmax regression in order to choose appropriate features.

The Urban Sound challenge was floated and the problem is meant to introduce for audio processing in the usual classification scenario. 
-model is implemented on keras framework and librose librairy is used for loding .wav file in the model.
Step 1: Load audio files
Step 2: Extract features from audio
Step 3: Convert the data to pass it in our deep learning model
Step 4: Run a deep learning model and get results

The dataset contains 8732 sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes, namely:

air conditioner,
car horn,
children playing,
dog bark,
drilling,
engine idling,
gun shot,
jackhammer,
siren, and
street music
